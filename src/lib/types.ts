/**
 * @module types
 * @description
 * Public TypeScript types for `@arraypress/waveform-player-svelte`.
 *
 * The shared option surface — `WaveformStyle`, `ColorPreset`,
 * `AudioMode`, `AudioPreload`, `ButtonAlign`, `WaveformMarker`,
 * `WaveformPeaks`, and the full per-option list behind
 * `WaveformPlayerProps` — is owned by the core library and re-exported
 * / extended here rather than re-declared. The core's hand-authored
 * `index.d.ts` is the single source of truth, so these types can never
 * drift out of sync with it.
 *
 * This module only adds the Svelte-specific surface:
 *
 *   - `WaveformPlayerProps` — the option surface accepted as props (the
 *     core options minus the callback fields).
 *   - `WaveformPlayerCallbacks` — the lowercase callback props
 *     (`onload`, `onplay`, …) Svelte components accept as attributes.
 *   - `WaveformPlayerExpose` — the imperative API exported by the
 *     component instance, reachable through `bind:this`.
 *
 * @see {@link https://github.com/arraypress/waveform-player} — core library
 */

/**
 * The option surface accepted by `<WaveformPlayer>` as props.
 *
 * Derived from the core library's `WaveformPlayerOptions` so every
 * library option is a typed prop automatically and stays in sync as
 * the core evolves. Two groups of core options are removed:
 *
 *  - the callbacks — lowercase Svelte callback props (`onload`,
 *    `onplay`, `onnexttrack`, …) cover those (see
 *    `WaveformPlayerCallbacks`).
 *  - `style` — the core's shorthand alias for `waveformStyle`. On this
 *    component `style` is the host `<div>`'s inline-CSS attribute (it is
 *    spread onto the element), so the core's alias would type it as a
 *    `WaveformStyle` while it's applied as CSS. Use `waveformStyle` for the
 *    visual style.
